    "> The whole figure. The Figure keeps track of all the child Axes, a group of 'special' Artists (titles, figure legends, colorbars, etc), and even nested subfigures.\n",

    "创建 `Figure` 的方式有：\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "fig = plt.figure()  # an empty figure with no Axes\n",
    "fig, ax = plt.subplots()  # a figure with a single Axes\n",
    "fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2)  # a figure with a 2x2 grid of Axes\n",
    "# a figure with one axes on the left, and two on the right:\n",
    "fig, axs = plt.subplot_mosaic([['left', 'right_top'], ['left', 'right_bottom']])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Axes\n",
    "\n",
    "> An Axes is an Artist attached to a Figure that contains a region for plotting data, and usually includes two (or three in the case of 3D) Axis objects (be aware of the difference between Axes and Axis) that provide ticks and tick labels to provide scales for the data in the Axes. Each Axes also has a title (set via set_title()), an x-label (set via set_xlabel()), and a y-label set via set_ylabel()).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The Axes class and its member functions are the primary entry point to working with the OOP interface, and have most of the plotting methods defined on them (e.g. ax.plot(), shown above, uses the plot method)\n",
    "\n",
    "`Axes` 既可以通过 `Figure` 对象来创建，也可以通过 `pyplot` 包中的方法来直接创建。\n",
    "\n",
    "### Axis\n",
    "\n",
    "> These objects set the scale and limits and generate ticks (the marks on the Axis) and ticklabels (strings labeling the ticks). The location of the ticks is determined by a Locator object and the ticklabel strings are formatted by a Formatter. The combination of the correct Locator and Formatter gives very fine control over the tick locations and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Artist\n",
    "\n",
    "> Basically, everything visible on the Figure is an Artist (even Figure, Axes, and Axis objects). This includes Text objects, Line2D objects, collections objects, Patch objects, etc. When the Figure is rendered, all of the Artists are drawn to the canvas. Most Artists are tied to an Axes; such an Artist cannot be shared by multiple Axes, or moved from one to another."
